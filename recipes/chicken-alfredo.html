            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
                    <li>½ (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>¼ cup milk</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                </ul>

            <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Place chicken into a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat; 
                        reduce heat and simmer until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 
                        about 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                        Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain. 
                        Drain cooked chicken and cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken, noodles, Alfredo sauce, 1/2 mozzarella cheese, milk, onion powder, 
                        and garlic powder in a large bowl and mix well. Pour into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. 
                        Layer remaining mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until melted and bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
